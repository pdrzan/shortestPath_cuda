# Algorithms to solve the shorthest path problem 

The repositorie is divided in 4 folder:

- First Implementation (uses GPU)
    > A modified matrix multiplication algorithm

- Second Implementation (user GPU)
    > Floyd's algortihm

- Sequencial Implementation (uses CPU)
    > Same modified matrix multiplication algorithm, but sequencial

- Lib
    > Useful methods that the algorithms use

The algorithms were tested in a colab with a T4 GPU. You can access it with the [link](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/10DzVXYa7kn9z_A5AamRLhTDBxnBmsFwB?usp=sharing)
